== Description ==

Asgard Security Scanner is a fast and free security tool that helps you detect malware in your WordPress installation. Secure your site and increase search ranking.
Our "Cloud" scanner helps you identify and remove any backdoors, trojans and hidden frames in themes/plugins.

Asgard Security Scanner is 100% free. This plugin searches the files on your website for anything security suspicious.

Key Security Features:

* Fully Managed Security Protection for Your Website
* Monitors filesystem security for unauthorized changes
* Run a security scan for malware and blacklists
* Reporting of security overview after WordPress blog is scanned
* Forbid common exploits and attack patterns

Blacklist Check:

* Google/Yandex SafeBrowsing malware and phishing check

Serious Malware Scanner:

No stupid line-by-line security scan. In common cases, malware injection strong encoded and encrypted.
Therefore, we scan files in two steps:

* Send file hashes and detect popular web-shells: c99, rst, r57 and many more blackhat tools.
* Send unknown files and our CloudAPI detects hacked files and encrypted backdoors.

We use Machine Learning algorithms for detect suspicious and malicious code. Use at your own risk ;)
